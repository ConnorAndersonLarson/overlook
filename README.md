## Abstract

The Overlook Hotel is a solo web build with a focus on SASS, OOP, TTD, and API database. The site is responsive to mobile, tablet and desktop views. On load users are met with a log-in page, after adding their username and password users are met with a list of all their bookings. Users can then add new bookings as they want, which are posted to a database. Styling is designed to emulate The Overlook Hotel from The Shining, based off the book of the same name written by Stephen King, and Directed by Stanley Kubrick, released in 1980.
